# Song Recommendation System using One Million Song Dataset
Song recommendation systems have immense business value as they improve user experience by allowing users to discover new relevant music, build their own streaming channels etc. leading them to consume more music and driving up companyâ€™s revenue.

In this project that I did for my Data Science and Big Data course at Carnegie Mellon, my teammate and I explored three types of recommendation models:

Popularity-based model
Item-based Collaborative Filtering
Latent Factor model (Singular Value Decomposition)
