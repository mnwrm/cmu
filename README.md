# Song Recommendation System using One Million Song Dataset
Song recommendation systems have immense business value as they improve user experience by allowing users to discover new relevant music, build their own streaming channels etc. leading them to consume more music and driving up companyâ€™s revenue.

In this project, Bai and I explored three types of recommendation models:

1. Popularity-based model

2. Item-based Collaborative Filtering

3. Latent Factor model (Singular Value Decomposition)
